// DOM = DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
//              Object{} that represents the page you see in the web browser 
//              and provides you with an API to interact with it.
//             Web browser constructs the DOM when it loads an HTML document,
//             and structures all the elements in a tree-like representation.
//             JavaScript can access the DOM to dynamically 
//             change the content, structure, and style of a web page.
